Overview
========

Provides `HTTP Signature`_ support for `Django REST framework`_. The HTTP Signature package provides a way to achieve origin authentication and message integrity for HTTP messages. Similar to Amazon's `HTTP Signature scheme`_, used by many of its services. The `HTTP Signature`_ specification is currently an IETF draft.

Installation
============

Installing the package via the repository::

   pip install djangorestframework-httpsignature

Older version of ``pip`` don't support the Wheel format (which is how ``httpsig`` is distributed). The problem manifests when installing the requirements, ``pip`` will complain that it cannot find a ``httpsig``. In such cases, ``pip`` needs to be upgraded::

  pip install --upgrade pip

Running the tests
=================

To run the tests for the packages, use the following command on the repository root directory::

  python manage.py test

Usage
=====

To authenticate HTTP requests via HTTP signature, you need to:

1. Install this package in your Django project, as instructed in `Installation`_.
2. Add ``rest_framework_httpsignature`` to your ``settings.py`` INSTALLED_APPS.
3. In your app code, extend the ``SignatureAuthentication`` class, as follows::

    # my_api/auth.py

    from rest_framework_httpsignature.authentication import SignatureAuthentication

    class MyAPISignatureAuthentication(SignatureAuthentication):
        # The HTTP header used to pass the consumer key ID.
        # Defaults to 'X-Api-Key'.
        API_KEY_HEADER = 'X-Api-Key'

        # A method to fetch (User instance, user_secret_string) from the
        # consumer key ID, or None in case it is not found.
        def fetch_user_data(self, api_key):
            # ...
            # example implementation:
            try:
                user = User.objects.get(api_key=api_key)
                return (user, user.secret)
            except User.DoesNotExist:
                return None


4. Configure Django REST framework to use you authentication class; e.g.::

    # my_project/settings.py

    # ...
    REST_FRAMEWORK = {
        'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
           'my_api.auth.MyAPISignatureAuthentication',
        ),
        'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': (
            'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',
        )
    }
    # The above will force HTTP signature for all requests.
    # ...


Roadmap
=======

- Currently, the library only support HMAC SHA256 for signing.
- The ``REQUIREMENTS.txt`` file is fairly strict. It is very possible that previous versions of Django and Django REST framework are supported.
- Since HTTP Signature uses a HTTP header for the request date and time, the authentication class could deal with request expiry.


Example usage & session w/cURL
==============================

Assuming the setup detailed in `Usage`_, a project running on ``localhost:8000`` could be probed with cURL as follows::

  ~$ SSS=Base64(Hmac(SECRET, "Date: Mon, 17 Feb 2014 06:11:05 GMT", SHA256))
  ~$ curl -v -H 'Date: "Mon, 17 Feb 2014 06:11:05 GMT"' -H 'Authorization: Signature keyId="my-key",algorithm="hmac-sha256",headers="date",signature="SSS"'

And for a much less painful example, check out the `httpsig package`_ documentation to use ``requests`` and ``httpsig``.
